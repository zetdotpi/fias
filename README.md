# Go FIAS structs and helpers

Structs and little helpers to deal with FIAS (Fidelio Interface Application Specification).

Based on this [FIAS protocol description](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E94145_01/docs/HGBU-HPI-IFC8-FIAS-Specification2.25.pdf).

## Library prospects

Current plan is to:
- [ ] Add message struct
- [ ] Create message parser
- [ ] something else?

If you have any ideas or/and suggestions feel free to make an issue with description.
